Dear Diary,

Today is Tuesday, July 16, 2024. The weather turned from light rain to clear.

Today was another day of overtime; I just got home.

In the morning, I went to work as usual and used Duolingo on the subway. When I got to the company, I had XiaoLongBao for breakfast, but without **vinegar** and **chili oil**, they didn't taste as good.

In terms of work, the daily tasks are almost the same, and I no longer know what to write. Today's meeting was mainly about the **retrospective** of the last **iteration** and the scheduling of the next **iteration**. I didn't complete a task in the last **iteration**, so it was **postponed** to the next one.

I watched an episode of The Orville last night; it was very interesting. I don't know what else to write, so that's it for today. I'm going to freshen up and then continue watching The Orville.

Goodnight, Diary. Until tomorrow.

Best, Jasper Van
