Dear Diary,

Today is Wednesday, July 17, 2024. The weather sunny.

I don't know why, but I'm very tired today. There were meetings again today, and I was busy dealing with various trivial matters. During the breaks, I wrote some code and finally completed a part of the work I've always wanted to do.

Goodnight, Diary. Until tomorrow.

Best, Jasper Van
