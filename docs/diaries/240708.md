Dear Diary,

Today is Monday,  An regular  working day. I took the subway to Houshayu, and then I took the **shuttle bus** to our company.

When I arrived our company, I went to the **canteen** and I bought a bowl of **instant noodles** and a piece of **Shredded Pancake**.  There‘s an crushed egg in the noodles, and **Roasted Sausage** in the **Shreded Pancake**. After the breakfast, I went to my office area.

My co-workers have all arrived. So I also sit down on my chair. I handled two pending MRs from last week. And when I finished them, I post them into our Lark Group for my co-workers to review.

It's time for lunch. I called my co-woker to the **canteen** together. Unexpectedly, there's grilled fish today. We ordered **Spicy Grilled Fish**. After lunch, we went outside the company, we took a walk under the **shade of trees** by the roadside.  I completed a set of IELTS listening practice tests.

There are no meetings this afternoon, so I can work in peace.

Originally planned to go home and study English, but today is the last day of the 360° assessment, so I have to spend time completing it first. I don't like it.

Goodnight, Diary. Until Tomorrow.

Best, Jasper Van
