Dear Diary,

Today is Saturday, July 27, 2024. The weather was sunny and sultry.

Today, a friend went to the **civil affairs bureau** to register for **marriage** and asked us to take photos. So we set off in the morning. The registration was quick, but taking photos was slow because many people were waiting in line. After finishing, we went to eat hot pot together. Then we went to watch a movie, and after the movie, we each went home.

Goodnight, Diary. Until tomorrow.

Best, Jasper Van
