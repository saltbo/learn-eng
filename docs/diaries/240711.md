Dear Diary,

Today is Thursday, July 11, 2024. The weather is sunny.

While doing Duolingo exercises on the shuttle bus today, I noticed a colleague was also using Duolingo. I am currently on the second part of the fifth stage, and the topic is ordering food delivery. When I arrived at our company, I walked through the lobby into the cafeteria. Today's breakfast was wonton soup.

When I arrived at my workstation, there was already **a pile of work** waiting for me. Before I could finish **the work at hand**, a meeting had already started. It was a ticket review meeting. We get a lot of tickets every week, so we need to **regularly review** and **identify issues** with the product for **resolution**. Yesterday, the leader asked me to complete the **classification** and **marking** of tickets before the meeting, but because I was in meetings all afternoon, I never had time to finish this task. Now I must hurry to finish it **before it's my turn to speak**. Long meetings are such a **pain**!

Today we received a ticket reporting that a function running on our platform was not receiving any input traffic. After spending some time checking, I found that an OOM kill status had **occurred** in the pod of the function. In the case of an OOM restart, the fission-agent will not re-specialize this pod, causing the function process to never start. Fission can be so **frustrating**!

In the afternoon, there was another two-hour long meeting...

After the meeting, I finally had time to write my document for tomorrow's sharing meeting. The meeting host is already urging me! Tomorrow, I need to make an **external presentation** to explain to users the "Component Management" feature we developed in the first half of the year. This is a company internal infrastructure application deployment platform based on the open-source project ArgoCD. I hope I won't mess up tomorrow.

Goodnight, Diary. Until tomorrow.

Best, Jasper Van
