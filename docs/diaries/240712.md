Dear Diary,

Today is Friday, July 12, 2024. It rained today.

I needed to share a product usage experience today, but the sharing document that should have been completed yesterday was not finished yet. As soon as I arrived at my workstation, I started working on the document. I finally finished it just before the deadline at around ten o'clock.

While writing the documentation, I discovered some front-end issues with our product. These issues **affected** the **presentation** I would share, so I had to **rush** to fix them. One issue **involved** a front-end dropdown selection box that needed to support remote search. Since I was not familiar with the parameters of this component, I wasted more than half an hour.

Before eating, I hadn't finished fixing the issues, so I went to eat with my colleagues first.

Today I had **shrimp** dumplings; they were great. Because there were still unresolved issues and it was raining, we did not take a walk and went straight back to the office area. Finally, before the lunch break, I fixed the front-end issue **affecting** the **presentation**.

Sleeping...

In the afternoon, the sharing session started at 2 p.m. It was an online meeting, and about 80 people **participated**. I shared the background of creating this product and provided a quick start guide. Then, I discussed best practices and answered **frequently** asked questions. Finally, I shared the current **shortcomings** of the product and future plans. The entire session took exactly an hour.

After the meeting, another **bunch** of messages was waiting for me. I replied to **various** messages, and then there was an issue handed over to colleagues for troubleshooting that they couldn't solve. I had to step in to help with the **troubleshooting** and **eventually** found that the account configured by a **former** colleague lacked the necessary permissions.

The busy week is finally over. Time to go home after work.

Goodnight, Diary. Until tomorrow.

Best, Jasper Van
