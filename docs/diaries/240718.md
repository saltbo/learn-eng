Dear Diary,

Today is Thursday, July 18, 2024. The weather is sunny.

This morning I had pancakes again, and I feel like I'm already tired of the food in the cafeteria. I got off work late again in the evening and had a burger at the KFC in the company park, which was pretty good. I might try it for breakfast later.

Today's meetings were not too **numerous**, so I managed to write some code. I also released two microservices online. Annoyingly, there was a meeting at the end of the workday, causing me to miss today's English speaking class. I need to set an alarm for Thursdays; I must leave work on time on that day.

Last night, I was still watching The Orville. It's really a great American TV show, and I've already watched the fifth episode. I think I understand what kind of show this is. It is a **sitcom set** on a space **battleship**. Many stories are written in this setting, and they are very interestingâ€”I can't guess the ending of each story. Episode 4 is about them **encountering** a super large battleship in space, as big as a city. The people inside have been living there for several generations, leading them to not even **realize** they are living on a battleship. Episode 5 is about them **encountering** a person who traveled from the future. She traveled back to save them, but because this **violates the principles** of the timeline, she has to take them away to the future. Of course, her main **purpose** is to sell their Orville spaceship.

Alright, I've been very tired from work recently and don't want to write anymore. I'm going to sleep now, but I'll watch two more episodes of The Orville before bed.

Goodnight, Diary. Until tomorrow.

Best, Jasper Van
