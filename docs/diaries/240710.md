Dear Diary,

Today is Tuesday, July 10, 2024. The weather is sunny.

I ate Yangchun noodles this morning. Then I went to work as usual and dealt with some cluster issues. For lunch, I had pork and **pickled** **cabbage** **stuffed** dumplings. In the afternoon, there was a meeting that lasted from 1:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. It's now 11 o'clock in the evening, and I just got home and finished **washing up**.

There were **sensitive** topics discussed in the meeting that I can't talk about, and the rest was boring and not worth mentioning, so that's all for today's diary.

Goodnight, Diary. Until tomorrow.

Best, Jasper Van
