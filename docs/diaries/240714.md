Dear Diary,

Today is Sunday, July 14, 2024. The weather is sunny.

I went swimming this morning and learned the **backstroke**! The feeling of **continuous movement** in the water is really good. When I use the **breaststroke**, I always **struggle** with my breathing and get very tired after one **lap**. But with the **backstroke**, I feel my breathing is **smoother**. I think after I practice the **backstroke** a bit more, I can enjoy myself more freely in the water.

After swimming, I went with my wife to **dye** her hair. While she was getting her hair done, I kept using Duolingo. Recently, I found out that a friend is also using it, and he spends two hours on Duolingo every day. That's crazy.

In the afternoon, I started studying the words I organized, mainly focusing on the advanced part. I threw all the words into ChatGPT and asked it to write an article for me. I hope that by doing this, I can connect these unrelated words. I'm not good at **rote** memorization; I'm better at **associative** memory.

Now, I can already remember a part of it. If I keep it up for two more days, I should be able to remember all of it.

Last night, I watched **Interstellar**. After watching part of it, I realized that I seemed to know the ending of the movie because I had come across it on a short video app. This somewhat **diminished** my **anticipation**. But I still think it's a really good science fiction movie.

Goodnight, Diary. Until tomorrow.

Best, Jasper Van
