Dear Diary,

Today is Thursday, July 25, 2024. The weather was light rain turning to cloudy.

It didn't rain much this morning, so I still went to work on time.

Today felt full of **miscellaneous** tasks, with various things needing to be handled. There were also two meetings, so there was very little time to focus on development.

I received an email from JetBrains reminding me that my open-source license will expire soon. I need to apply for another year, but I found that the open-source project Zpan I am using has not been updated for more than half a year. To renew this license, I also need to update Zpan.

Nothing else to write about today.

Goodnight, Diary. Until tomorrow.

Best, Jasper Van
