Dear Diary,

Today is Monday, July 15, 2024. The weather is cloudy.

The first day of the new week was full of meetings. The morning was **occupied** by an **inter-departmental** meeting, and the afternoon was filled with a bunch of **intra-departmental** meetings. I got pulled into a weekly meeting right before getting off work, so I couldn't leave on time. After the meeting, I grabbed a quick bite at the 7-Eleven downstairs and then rushed to catch the shuttle bus home.

Sadly, I didn't write a single line of code today.

In the evening, I continued memorizing words. Today, there are only three words that are still unfamiliar.

I started watching the American TV series "The Orville" last night. It's quite interesting. I'll continue watching it today to see how it goes.

Goodnight, Diary. Until tomorrow.

Best, Jasper Van
