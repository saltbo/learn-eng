Dear Diary,

Today is Saturday, July 13, 2024. The weather is cloudy.

As a software developer, I have an **occupational** habit. Because I am not **satisfied** with any of the English learning software and websites on the market, I always want to design software that allows learners to customize their own learning plans, such as how to learn vocabulary more **efficiently** and how to improve speaking skills.

In fact, I have wasted a lot of study time because of this. If I had enough time, I believe that sharpening the knife would not delay the cutting of **firewood**, but I don't have that **luxury**. I must pass the IELTS exam as soon as possible and **acquire** the ability to work in English quickly. So, I decided to use more **straightforward** methods for now.

This morning, I compiled 179 key IELTS listening words recommended in a book and put them on my English learning website. Based on my **familiarity** with these words, I **divided** them into three parts: simple, medium, and advanced. The simple parts are words I have completely mastered, I can understand and spell them. The medium parts are words I feel very familiar with but can't read or write. The advanced parts are completely unfamiliar.

**Overall**, the number of words in the advanced section is not very large. I need a week to fully **familiarize** myself with them. Wish me luck, I hope to master them soon.

In other news, I watched a movie last night â€” **District** 9. This is a 2009 film that tells the story of alien **refugees** **stranded** on Earth due to a spaceship **malfunction**. I like this story because, on one hand, it has a science fiction background, and on the other hand, On the other hand, it also shows us the problem of human **racial discrimination**. **Although** the aliens in the movie **appear** very ugly from a human **perspective**, they are actually very kind. In **contrast**, humans appear **uglier** when it comes to racial discrimination. At the end of the story, the escaped alien promised to come back and **heal** the **protagonist** in three years. I'm looking forward to a **sequel**, but it's been more than ten years, and it feels like there won't be a second part.

Okay, let's call it a day. I'm going to watch another movie.

Goodnight, Diary. Until tomorrow.

Best, Jasper Van
