Dear Diary,

Today is Wednesday, July 24, 2024. The weather is stuffy, and it started raining in the evening.

Today, the company unusually allowed us to leave early, so I could go home from work at 4 o'clock. This was mainly because the weather **forecast** **predicted** heavy rain. On the shuttle bus, I was watching anime. On the subway, I was using Duolingo. When I got home, I continued using Duolingo and ordered **takeout**. When my takeout arrived, I ate while watching anime. My wife sent me a message, but I didn't get a notification while watching **anime**. It had already started raining, and my wife **complained** that I didn't go pick her up because she didn't bring an umbrella.

Today's work mainly **involved** cluster migration. Yesterday, we set up a new cluster. Our plan is to replace the old cluster with this new one. Today, I migrated all the services from the old cluster to the new cluster. During the migration process, we **encountered** **a bunch of** problems. The most **frustrating** one was that many Docker image mirror sites in China were forcibly taken offline due to policy reasons, including the image mirror site provided by our cloud service provider. Poor Chinese developers~

Recently, I've been **binge-watching** The Orville, but I don't really want to write about what I watch every day in my diary. Maybe I'll write a **separate** review for each episode in the future.

Okay, that's it for today.

Goodnight, Diary. Until tomorrow.

Best, Jasper Van
