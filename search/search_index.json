The weather is cloudy.</p> <p>As a software developer, I have an occupational habit. Because I am not satisfied with any of the English learning software and websites on the market, I always want to design software that allows learners to customize their own learning plans, such as how to learn vocabulary more efficiently and how to improve speaking skills.</p> <p>In fact, I have wasted a lot of study time because of this. If I had enough time, I believe that sharpening the knife would not delay the cutting of firewood, but I don't have that luxury. I must pass the IELTS exam as soon as possible and acquire the ability to work in English quickly. So, I decided to use more straightforward methods for now.</p> <p>This morning, I compiled 179 key IELTS listening words recommended in a book and put them on my English learning website. Based on my familiarity with these words, I divided them into three parts: simple, medium, and advanced. The simple parts are words I have completely mastered, I can understand and spell them. The medium parts are words I feel very familiar with but can't read or write. The advanced parts are completely unfamiliar.</p> <p>Overall, the number of words in the advanced section is not very large. I need a week to fully familiarize myself with them. Wish me luck, I hope to master them soon.</p> <p>In other news, I watched a movie last night \u2014 District 9. This is a 2009 film that tells the story of alien refugees stranded on Earth due to a spaceship malfunction. I like this story because, on one hand, it has a science fiction background, and on the other hand, On the other hand, it also shows us the problem of human racial discrimination. Although the aliens in the movie appear very ugly from a human perspective, they are actually very kind. In contrast, humans appear uglier when it comes to racial discrimination. At the end of the story, the escaped alien promised to come back and heal the protagonist in three years. I'm looking forward to a sequel, but it's been more than ten years, and it feels like there won't be a second part.</p> <p>Okay, let's call it a day.

I think after I practice the backstroke a bit more, I can enjoy myself more freely in the water.</p> <p>After swimming, I went with my wife to dye her hair.

However, they convict a person through a nationwide vote. Everyone has a voting device with two buttons: like or dislike. If a person's dislikes exceed a certain number, they will be corrected (Correction process). This plot makes us reflect that absolute democracy also has certain problems.

I organized these because they could all be material for conversation. Everyone's life experiences are a kind of talking point. The biggest problem for adults learning English is that they can't express their existing talking points in English, so I hope to first remember their English names.</p> <p>At noon, I studied Duolingo for an hour. Now I am ranked second on the diamond leaderboard. I hope to be ranked first by the end of this week so that I can get the rare gem badge.</p> <p>In the afternoon, I started taking an English course for developers that I previously found on Twitter. It's called A2 English for Developers. During class, I realized that I couldn't remember the city names in the course, which reminded me of another batch of vocabulary I wanted to organize, specifically locations. So in the afternoon, I organized the names of major cities in all countries and continents. You can see it under Movies.</p> <p>I watched three episodes of The Orville last night, but I only found two of them interesting. Episode 8 is about the doctor on the spaceship preparing to go on vacation with her two sons, accompanied by Isaac (who comes from a robot civilization). While flying in space, they encountered a space rift. In a moment of crisis, due to the mischief of the two children, a phone was smashed onto the control panel, causing the spaceship to be sucked into the space rift. The space rift transported them to a distant star region, but the spaceship was severely damaged and was about to crash, so they had to make an emergency landing on an oxygen-rich planet.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the spacecraft split into two parts during the crash landing, separating the doctor from them. The doctor was knocked unconscious and taken away by a local. Isaac had to take care of the two children. During this process, Isaac not only protected the two children but also educated them, making them treat their mother better. Eventually, the doctor escaped back to the crash site of the spaceship. She found that her two children had changed, so she was very grateful to Isaac.</p> <p>Episode 9 is very funny. The first scene of the first season is about the protagonist's wife having an affair with a blue-skinned alien. That blue-skinned alien appeared again in this episode; it turns out he is also an archaeologist. In this episode, they receive a mission to mediate the conflict between two alien races and prevent them from going to war. The two alien races have been fighting over the ownership of a planet. This time, they discover an ancient artifact and reach an agreement to determine the original inhabitants of the planet by analyzing the DNA of the ancient artifact. The planet will belong to the race identified as the earliest inhabitants.</p> <p>In this process, the protagonist's ex-wife actually slept with the blue-skinned alien. The funny thing is, somehow, the protagonist also fell in love with him and wanted to sleep with him too. During this process, because the male protagonist fell deeply in love, he completely ignored the aliens from the two races. So they decided to go to war. Seeing that a great war was inevitable, in the end, two members of different alien races suddenly fell in love. It turns out that when that blue-skinned alien is in heat, something is produced on his skin that makes people fall in love with him...</p> <p>Goodnight, Diary.

After swimming, we went for a massage. Sitting for long periods at work has made my body uncomfortable for a long time. We had lunch at a small hot pot restaurant nearby. It was a self-service hot pot, similar to a conveyor belt sushi restaurant.</p> <p>In the afternoon, I started frantically earning experience points on Duolingo because I was only 2,000 points away from first place on the leaderboard. This is the closest I've ever been to that rare diamond badge. After swiping for more than two hours, I finally got first place. If nothing unexpected happens, I will receive the badge tomorrow. I'm so happy.</p> <p>I finished watching the first season of The Orville last night and also watched two episodes of the second season. I felt great about the last two episodes of the first season.</p> <p>Episode eleven is about them accidentally discovering a two-dimensional space. They didn't directly crash into that space; only one corner of the spaceship passed through it, causing a plant to die instantly. It also caused their engine to malfunction, so they had to stay in place for repairs. Then they discovered another space pirate ship was about to crash into that space. They warned the other ship, but the other ship didn't believe them. Then everyone on that ship died. They discovered that the spaceship had stolen items from the enemy of the alliance, which might attract pursuit from enemy warships. Sure enough, they were approaching soon, and they had to find a way to hide in two-dimensional space. Inside, they saw a shocking scene: a world of two-dimensional space.</p> <p>This plot reminded me of Interstellar, which I watched some time ago. It's a very interesting storyline about worlds of various dimensions.</p> <p>Episode twelve is about them discovering a planet in an unfamiliar star region. This planet disappears from the universe for a period of time every few days and then reappears. When the female protagonist arrived on this planet to investigate, she discovered that they were still in the Bronze Age. She accidentally scared a child, and the child fell and got injured. Then she used their technological means to treat his injury. Then she quickly left that planet.</p> <p>A dozen days later, when this planet reappeared, they found that the civilization on this planet had already developed for 700 years. The people on the planet have already regarded the heroine as a god. They had to go back to the planet to find the Pope and explain to her that it was just a misunderstanding. Eventually, the Pope believed her and decided to make it public. Unfortunately, due to the short time, they had to leave immediately. After they left, the Pope's subordinates assassinated the Pope. The result they expected did not happen, and that world continued to regard her as a god. When the next cycle appeared, they had already evolved to a state similar to the 21st century of humanity. This time, they decided to send someone to that planet for 700 years, so there would be enough time to correct this mistake. This candidate could only be Isaac because he is a robot and won't die of old age there. In the end, by the next meeting, humans on this planet had successfully evolved to nearly their level. A perfect ending.</p> <p>Goodnight, Diary.
